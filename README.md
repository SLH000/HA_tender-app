# HK HA Tender Award App

This project leverages Streamlit to build an interactive web app for analyzing and visualizing hospital tender data from Hong Kong's Hospital Authority (HK HA). It scrapes HTML tables, cleans the data, categorizes contractors, and provides filtering options for users. The data is presented with a table and a bar chart to show contractor distribution. Users can also download the filtered contractor list.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: The app scrapes an HTML table from a user-provided URL.
- **Data Cleaning**: The app cleans and organizes the data, renaming columns, removing irrelevant rows, and categorizing tender subjects.
- **Filtering**: Users can filter contractors by hospital and category via the sidebar.
- **Data Download**: Users can download the filtered contractor list as a CSV file.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays a bar chart showing the distribution of contractors.
